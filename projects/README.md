# Guide for using the potential_fitting library

The file potential_fitting.py contains all the methods one should need to work thru the 1b and first half of the 2b workflow.

Simply import potential_fitting.py and then call the available methods on your files to move thru the workflow.

potential_fitting.py is thouroughly documented py method comments. run help(potential_fitting) to get a list of all the available methods, or help(potential_fitting.some_method()) to get a detailed description of the meaning of each of the arguments of that method.

The complicated GUIDE.md that used to exist has been removed as it is no longer needed.

Keep in mind that you will still have to be on a computer with maple installed to run the maple part of the program.
