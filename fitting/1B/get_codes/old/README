# The poly* files refer to the *.cpp and *.h files of the monomer generated in polynomial_generation
# The poly_gen_input.in file refers to the monomer input file in polynomial_generation
# This script :  1. Creates all files necessary for the fitting code 
#                2. Compiles the code 
#                3. Generates executables fit* eval* eval*wgrads 
# Find the files in destination/

$ ./fit-1b-polynomials [training_set.xyz] > [log_file]
# In destination/ , this fits the polynomials to your training set in xyz format.
# The energies of the training set must be in kcal/mol in the comment line.
# This also produces a correlation plot with the energies in this order: TrainingSetEnergy  FitEnergy
# The default weighting parameter is 50 kcal/mol.
