##PB:

# To compile the code :
1. Go to src/ and modify the -D flags for your system (ION?(FLUORIDE, CHLORIDE, BROMIDE, IODIDE) and %POL?(POL0, POL25, POL50, POL75, POL100, POL_EFF))

2. Then do: 
$ make 

This creates two executables in ../bin/ fit* and eval-pot

Note: There is a Makefile for tscc as well in src/. To use it do "make -f Makefile.tscc" instead of "make" in src/. Ion and polarizability will have to be defined similarly in Makefile.tscc

To run the codes, go to ../bin/

$ fit-x2b-h2o-ion-v1 x h2o-ion-training-set.xyz 
where, x is to use the default initial guesses for the non-linear parameters. There are 3 different default initial guesses implemented in src/fit-x2b-h2o-ion-v1.cpp, use "x", "a" or "b".
       h2o-ion-training-set.xyz must contain the configurations in xyz format, with energies in the comment line in this order: BindingEnergy   TwoBodyEnergy   MonomerDistortionE1  MonomerDistortionE2 
The final fit parameters will be in fit-x2b-h2o-ion-v1.cdl 

$ eval-pot fit.nc h2o-ion.xyz 
This returns the 2B energy from the fit in "fit.nc" 
To get fit.nc do : ncgen -o fit.nc fit-x2b-h2o-ion-v1.cdl
		where, fit-x2b-h2o-ion-v1.cdl is the output from the fitting code.
