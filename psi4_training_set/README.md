#### Training Set Generation
This directory contains the scripts to read in geometries using pybel and calculates their 1B energies using psi4.

`run_psi4.py` uses Open Babel's Pybel wrapper which is a lighter version of the module that allows file input/output etc.

In the future, this will contain a script(s) to read in geometries and calculate 1B, 2B, and 3B reference energies using Psi4.
