Python script to perform calculations of energies on one-body molecules.
A script to perform calculations on two-body interactions has yet to be made.
To run the script, use the following in the command line:

python run_psi4_1B.py @config.args

In the config.args file, you can customize the settings to feed options
that can be used by the script, rather than putting all the arguments
at once in the command line.

Right now, only memory, method, basis, and input are used.
