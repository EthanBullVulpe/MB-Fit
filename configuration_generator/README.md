# Normal Configuration Generator

Automated scripts to generate the optimized geometry, normal modes, and a set of normal distribution configurations for a reference geometry.

## Usage:
`python generate_nm_configs.py [config]`
The driver script can be run from the command line with a single positional input being the `.ini` file that contains the configuration settings for the script.

**Configuation file format:**
```
[file_input]
input_geometry_path =	h2o.xyz     *the .xyz file containing the starting geometry*

[molecule]
charge =		        0           *the charge of the molecule*
multiplicity =		    1           *the spin multiplicity of the molecule*

[config_generator]
random =		        Q           *whether a Q(uasirandom) or P(suedorandom) sequence is to be used*
num_configs =		    128         *the number of configurations to generate*
geometric =		        false       *whether or not a geometric progression is to be used for temperature T and A*
linear =		        true        *whether or not a linear progression is to be used for temperature T and A*

[model]
method =		        blyp        *the calculation model method to use*
basis =			        cc-pvdz     *the calculation model basis to use*

[program]
code = 			        psi4        *which quantum chemistry code to use for the calculations*
memory = 		        1GB         *the amount of memory to allocate to the selected code*
num_threads = 		    2           *the number of threads to run on for the selected code*
```

## Outputs

`prefix_normalmodes.dat` - Contains the normal modes following the frequency calculations (ready to be input into gcn)
`prefix.inp` - The input for Sandra's gcn
`prefix.out` - The log outputs for Sandra's gcn
`prefix_configurations.xyz` - The normal mode configurations generated by Sandra's gcn
