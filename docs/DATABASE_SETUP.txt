# setting up a postgreSQL server
choose the appropriate installation gude from:
https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Detailed_installation_guides

once you have installed postgres, you may launch the server using:
```
postgres -D /usr/local/pgsql/data
```
For troubleshooting and more information, check:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/server-start.html

Next, create a database on the server with the following command:
```
createdb <name of database>
```
For troubleshooting and more information, check:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/tutorial-createdb.html

Then, connect to the database (still from the host machine) using
```
psql mydb
```
For troubleshooting and more information, check:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/tutorial-accessdb.html

Next, we will add users with passwords so that the database can be accessed
securely and remotely.
From inside the database console opened by ```psql mydb``` run
```
CREATE USER <username> WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD '<new password>'
```
For more details, see:
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/sql-createuser.html

How you handle users is up to you, you may create one user for each member of
your team, or you may make a single username and password to share.

Now, you should be able to log into the database remotely from a client machine.
To do so run the following on the client:
Note that you will need to have the postgresql client installed, which you can get from here:
https://www.postgresql.org/download/
```
psql -h <host name or IP> -p <host port> -d <database name> -u <username>
```
You will be prompted for your password.

Then, run database_setup.py in order to initialize the tables and routines needed to run the MB-Fit server. database_setup.py is located in the home MB-Fit directory.
database_setup.py takes a database config file as its argument.
The format of the database config file should be as follows:
```
[database]
host = <host name or IP>
port = <host port of connection>
database = <name of the database>
username = <your username>
password = <your password>
```

Before putting your password in any file, make sure to use
```
chmod 700 <name of file>
```
to make sure only you can access the file.

Also, of course, use a unique password.
