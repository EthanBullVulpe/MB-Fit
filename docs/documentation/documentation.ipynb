In classical force fileds, the interactions between atoms are usually divided in bonded and non-bonded interactions. Typically, two atoms will be bonded if there are three or less bonds of distance between those two atoms, and non-bonded otherwise. When two atoms within the same molecule are non-bonded, the non-bonded interactions sucha as repulsion, dispersion and electrostatics are calculated, and ignored or scaled if the two atoms are bonded. The SMILES string will allow `MB-Fit` to find the connectivity matrix of the molecule.\n",

For example, the SMILES string 'C1CC1' species a ring of 3 carbons. When there are multiple digits after a single atom each digit is treated independently. For instance, 'C12.C23.C31' also specifies a ring of 3 carbons. In this representation we have removed the implicit bond between adjacent atoms by adding a dot, and then introduced bonds between each pair of carbon atoms. If you need to specify more than 10 bonds you can use % signs to combine multiple digits: 'C%10%20.C%20%30.C%30%10' also specifies a ring of 3 carbons.\n",

The symmetrization process, which is also performed in the generation of the polynomials, fixes this issue. Instead of having two terms $K_1\\xi _{AB_1}$ and $K_2\\xi _{AB_2}$, the algorithm will symetrize them into $K_{\\alpha}(\\xi _{AB_1} + \\xi _{AB_2})$. With this new term it doesnt matter which atom B is B$_1$ or B$_2$, and it will always evaluate to the same value no matter the order of identical atoms.

    "In any machine learning scheme, the goal is to be able to predict the outcome of an event by using knowledge of events in which the outcome is known. In the case of energy, the goal is to predict the energy of a molecular system given the coordinates of all the atoms. We need to train the model with configurations for which the energy is known. These set of configurations will be the **training set**. To assess that the model actually predicts the right energies, we will also need a set of configurations for which the energy is known, but that will not be included in the training set. This set of configurations will be called the **test set**. Usually we will assess the accuracy of a fit by calculating the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the training and test sets. Ideally, both sets should have a low RMSD and of a cimilar order of magnitude. To calculate the RMSD, the following expression is used:\n",
    "$$\\text{RMSD} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum _{i=1} ^N (y_i^{calc} - y_i^{ref})^2}{N}}$$\n",

    "The degree of the polynomial and the size of the training set must be carefully selected to avoid underfitting and overfitting. Underfitting occurs when the function used as model is not flexible enough to reproduce the reference data. An example of underfitting is found on the left panel in the figure below. The model used is a straight line, and it is trying to reproduce a curve with not much success. Although this is a problem in terms of accuracy of the model, it usually does not represent a problem in its stability. However, when the model has too many parameters in comparison with the number of points in the training set, overfitting can occur. The fit will have an apparent excellent agreement with the reference data, but the test set will probably have a bad agreement with the model. When the RMSD of the training set is small, but the one for the test set is large, overfitting is most likely happening and we need to either increase the size of our training set, or decrease the number of terms. When overfitting occurs, there is a big chance of finding **holes** in the PEF, which means that the models does not have information in a region of the space, and the energy that is predicted is usually largely negative, as it is shown in the right pannel of the figure below. Ideally, the wanted behavior is the one shown in the central pannel, in which the model behaves properly within the range of the sample points."

However, distorted configurations must also appear to avoid extrapolationg values for the polynomials. The average energy, following a Boltzman distribution, in a molecular dynamics simulation at room temperature is 0.593 kcal/mol. Technically, having distortions up to 0.6 kcal/mol should be enough to have a stable simulation at room temperature. However, 0.593 kcal/mol is the average energy that a molecule will have, and does not mean that a higher values are not possible. There might be instantaneous fluctuations in which the molecule is distorted several kcal/mol, and if those configurations are not sampled in the training set, the PEF will have a hole, giving a non-physical value for the energy. The recomendation is to use a maximum distortion energy ($E_i ^{dist} = E_i -E_i ^{min}$) of 100 kcal/mol.

Each file needs to be added in a different function call. `method` and `basis` are the electronic structure method and basis set that will be used to calculate the energies of the configurations added. When using small basis sets, and even large basis sets that are not close to the complete basis set limit, it is recomended to use counter-poise correction to correct for the basis set superposition error (BSSE). This option can be activated by setting `cp` to `True`. This correction only takes effect if there is more than one monomer, so for the one-body calculations can be set to `False`."

Two tags will be used: `\"training_nh3\"` for the training set and `\"test_nh3\"` for the test set. Finally, the `optimized` argument indicates if the configurations added are optimized (the minimum energy structure) or not, and can be set to `True` or `False`.
