Python script to perform calculations of energies on 
monomers, dimers, and trimers.

To run the script, use the following in the command line:

python run_psi4.py @config.args

In the config.args file, you can customize the settings to feed options
that can be used by the script, rather than putting all the arguments
at once in the command line.

Right now, only memory, method, basis, and input are used.
